# Time complexity:  O(log(n)), at most will use log(n) time to find in the tree
# Space complexity: O(1), only use constant amount of ram to store pointers
# Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Bad: 3
#  1 - 5 , try 3 -> 3 is bad -> Range become 1 - 2
#  1 - 2 , try 2 -> 2 is good -> Range become 3 - 2
#  Loop end -> return 3 -> ok

# Example: [1]ï¼Œ Bad: 1
# 1 - 1, try 1 -> 1 is bad -> Range become 1 - 0
# Loop end return 1 -> ok

# Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Bad: 4
#  1 - 5 , try 3 -> 3 is good -> Range become 4 - 5
#  4 - 5 , try 4 -> 4 is bad -> Range become 4 - 3
